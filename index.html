                        <li><strong>Title:</strong> Two Twisted Crowns</li>
                        <li><strong>Author:</strong> Rachel Gillig</li>
                        <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Dark Fantasy, YA Fantasy</li>
                        <li><strong>Series:</strong> The Shepard King Duology</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong> In <em>One Dark Window</em>, the first book of <em>The Shepard King Duology</em>, we follow the journey of a protagonist with a mysterious power. The world is gothic, magical, and full of secrets, as characters struggle with both external threats and their internal demons. The gripping plot unravels through a kingdom plagued by a powerful curse, and the relationships between characters grow complex and intriguing. The second book, <em>Two Twisted Crowns</em>, continues the saga, deepening the mystery and the stakes in a darker, more dangerous world.</p>
                    <p><strong><u>Expectations:</u></strong> Iâ€™m really excited to see how the characters evolve and how the mysteries unfold. After the first book's cliffhanger, I'm eager to get my hands on the conclusion. If you enjoy dark, atmospheric fantasies with strong character development and plot twists, this is definitely a series you should check out!</p>
